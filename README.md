# Advent Of Code 2022

Link to challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

I used OCaml to be more proficient at this language.

You can run each solution for each day using `ocaml <file>`: for example, to run `day01.ml`, you would run
```
ocaml day01.ml
```

My specific inputs live in the `inputs/` folder.

For some reason, my environment was not correctly configured after a while. I fixed it by running
```
eval $(opam env)
```
later, based on `https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running#3-create-an-opam-switch`.
